! Problem 1: In 3-4 sentences, please explain what Big O Notation is.
Its basically a way on analyzing the run Time for the algorithm to execute as the Input Size 
of the algorithm and finding an asymptotic upper bound. 
As it the input grows or it scales this brings a measure into two (2) parts of efficiency in which the 
Time Complexity and Space Complexity. 
Time complexity is a measure on how long does the function goes to run in computational steps.
Space complexity has to do with the amount of memory used by the function.
Big O doesnt say in which  the best case scenario of a test was presented but the worse case on performing

*/

/*
! Problem 2: For each of the time complexities shown below:

- Name the complexity
- Rank from 1-5 (1 being the best, 5 being the worst) 
- Describe in 1-2 sentences of the complexity
- Provide a code example of how the complexity works
*/

/*
Name: O(1) - Constant time complexity
Rank: 1
Describe:  Constant Time Complexity take a constant amount of time to run, independently of the size of n.
When there is no dependence on the input size n, an algorithm is said to have a constant time of order
Sample: 
const twoSum = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 + num2
*/

/*
Name: O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity
Rank: 2
Describe: complexity is often related to divide and conquer algorithms when it needs to find a number or create divisions. 
Also common in recursive and binary search since it divides iteration to describe on a binary tree in which size n is divided 
into sub-problem of size n/2 until we reach a problem of size 1
Sample:
    let numberOfLoops = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i<arr1.length; i*=2) {
        numberOfLoops++
    }
    return numberOfLoops
}
*/

/*
Name: O(n) - Linear time complexity
Rank: 3
Describe: Time complexity grows in direct proportion to the size of the input. 
Or when there is no dependence on the input size n, an algorithm is said to have a constant time of order
Sample:
for(let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i])

}
*/
 
/*
Name: O(n^2) Quadratic time complexity
Rank: 4
Describe: Time complexity grows in direct proportion to the size of the input. 
It can be descrive as a matrix since it computes an area of the program
Sample:
n = 4
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++){
    for (let j = 1; i < n; j++){
        console.log(i,j)
    }
}
}
*/

/*
Name: O(n!) Factorial Time Complexity
Rank: 5
Describe: When the size of the input data decreases in each step by a certain factor, an algorithm will have logarithmic time complexity.
This means as the input size grows, the number of operations that need to be executed grows comparatively much slower.
Sample:
const factorial = (n) => {
    let num = n; // num = 5 (sample)
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        num = n * factorial(n -1); // num = 5 * 4 * 3 ...
    }
    return num;
}
console.log(factorial(5))
}
*/

/*
! Problem 3: Name 3 reasons why we care about Big O and we care about code performance. 
    - Code Optimze when accessing and processing the code that even with a lot of features it wont be affected.
    - Easier on the maintenance that adding and deleting features wont be a problem.
    - Save and Earn a lot of money since faster sites gets more tractions.
*/

/*
! Problem 4: What is the problem of using a time method such as performance.now() to measure how “fast” a code runs on our machines.
    In measuring using perforamace.now() will be a problem if tried on a bigger scale since 
    every computer is different in systems, hardwares, operating systems, and more.
    this may result in which the program seem faster on your end while on slower hardwares will seem noticable.

In the start we can see that the arr1 opo is a constant
after that the for function will be a linear both on do something 2 and 3 then

/*

! Problem 7: Please explain in 3-5 sentences why we can ignore constants and consolidate our time complexities. 
Constant will be negligible as the actual growth impact comes from the Big O, When calculating the time complexities is 
at which the data will grow and having a constant on there will be irrelevant when there will be a large input presented. 
It is the "heavy" or worse time complexity in which we need to find which is the slowest run time and see
the biggest impact which the code runs at.

when the time complexity is created the input within the fuction the amount of time to run related to the input.
